Trajecstory 0.3
---------------

Trajecstory is a program that plots the trajectory of a single electron in
electric and magnetic fields. In this version the fields are kept constant
in time, but may vary in space.

For students of Physics, the utility of such a program is immediately obvious,
and no further explanation is required. For others, it has no utility, and
further explanation is pointless.

Changes in version 0.3
----------------------
1. A facility is added to the user interface to save the trajectory to a data file as an option .
2. Some additional data on the trajectory is now presented on the screen.
3. The internal implementation of the field variation across the x,y,z axes has been modified.
4. The User's guide has been updated.
5. Some modification to the placement of the widgets on the GUI has been made.

Availability, Compilation and Installation
------------------------------------------

Trajecstory is available as source code to compile on your own machine, as well as a
binary to install and use.

Compiling the source
--------------------

In order to compile the source code, you need the Qt Software Development Kit and the
GNU Scientific Library (GSL) development files. These can be retrieved from the repositories of
your Linux installation using the standard package manager which has been provided with
your system.

The development libraries of Qt are also available from www.qt-project.org.
The GSL is also available from https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.

The Mesa (OpenGL alternative) development files are also required, as well as the standard
C/C++ development tools.

Untar and unzip the downloaded package with the command:

tar -zxvf tr-0.3-dist.tar.gz

This will create a sub-directory called tr-0.3-dist. If you are using QtCreator, which is an
integrated development environment for Qt, the project file to load into QtCreator will be
available in this location.

Open QtCreator, and load the project file tr.pro which is available in the source package.
Select the version you want to build (debug version or release version) and hit Ctrl-B. If
there are no problems, this should build the binary.

The program has been compiled and tested on version 4.8.7  of Qt, on Ubuntu Linux 17.04.
Ctrl-r executes the binary. The binary may be kept in directories separate from the source
subdirectory, depending on how QtCreator is configured. This location will be available within
QtCreator.

If you are not using QtCreator, then the Qt development libraries and the GNU Scientific Library
(GSL) should be pre-installed on your system. Also required is the g++ compiler and development
files, as well as the "make" utility. Inside the subdirectory "tr-dist" is a Makefile, and running
the "make" command should build the executable.

The location of the locally compiled binary will be available from within QtCreator. From this
location copy you may like to copy the binary to a place from where everyone working on the
computer can run it. In a terminal window, first become superuser:
su
<type the root password>

Then change to the subdirectory containing the binary and do:
cp ./tr /usr/local/bin/tr

Copy the help file to the same location:
cp ./trhelp.pdf /usr/local/bin/trhelp.pdf

That's it.

Installing the binaries under Linux
-----------------------------------

All the source files are available on Github under the following link:
https://github.com/letapk/trajecstory

The repository is public. Anyone can check out the branch onto her local machine.

In addition, you will need the libraries and developement files from Qt, which are
available from the depository of your Linux distribution or from www.qt.io.
The current source tree compiles and runs using Qt version 5.15.3.

Also required are the development files and libraries of the GNU Scientific library.
They can be found from the GNU website, www.gnu.org, as well as the Linux distribution
depository for your system.

If you are using QtCreator, load the project file tr.pro which is available in the source
package. Select the version you want to build (debug version or release version) and hit
Ctrl-B. If there are no problems, this should build the binary.

The program has been compiled and tested on version 5.15.3 of Qt, under Ubuntu
22.04.

The binary may be stored locally in a directoriy separate from the source subdirectory,
depending on how QtCreator is configured. This location will be available within QtCreator.

If you are not using QtCreator, running the comand:
qmake tr.pro
should create a Makefile for your system. Then, running:
make
should create a running binary.
