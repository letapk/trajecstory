Trajecstory 0.4
---------------

Trajecstory is a program that plots the trajectory of a single electron in
electric and magnetic fields. In this version the fields are kept constant
in time, but may vary in space.

For students of Physics, the utility of such a program is immediately obvious,
and no further explanation is required. For others, it has no utility, and
further explanation is pointless.

Changes in version 0.3
----------------------
1. A facility is added to the user interface to save the trajectory to a data file as an option .
2. Some additional data on the trajectory is now presented on the screen.
3. The internal implementation of the field variation across the x,y,z axes has been modified.
4. The User's guide has been updated.
5. Some modification to the placement of the widgets on the GUI has been made.

Availability, Compilation and Installation
------------------------------------------

Trajecstory is available as source code to compile on your own machine, from the
repository maintained on GitHub.

Compiling the source
--------------------

All the source files are available on Github under the following link:
https://github.com/letapk/trajecstory
The current source tree compiles and runs using Qt version 5.15.3, under Kubuntu 22.04.

The repository is public. Anyone can check out the branch onto her local machine.

You will need the following:
Libraries and development files from Qt (www.qt.io).

The development files and libraries of the GNU Scientific library, GSL (www.gnu.org.).

The OpenGL libraries and development files.

All these are available from the depository of your Linux distribution, and can be
installed using the package manager of your system.

Download all the files in the repository in one subdirectory.

If you are using QtCreator, load the project file tr.pro.
Select the version you want to build (debug version or release version) and hit
Ctrl-B. If there are no problems, this should build the binary.

The binary may be stored locally in a directoriy separate from the source subdirectory,
depending on how QtCreator is configured. This location will be available within QtCreator.

If you are not using QtCreator, run the comand:
qmake tr.pro
This should create a Makefile for your system. Then, running:
make
should create a running binary.

There is no particular requirement as regards installation. However, in order to see the
license and help file from within the program, the files COPYING and trhelp.pdf should be
in the same location from where the program is run.
