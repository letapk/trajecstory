The executable has the following issues:

1. During compilation, a deprecated message is emitted regarding a variable.

2. During execution, there are multiple "BadMatch" messages with reference to xcb.

3. During execution, a message about a failure to compose table is emitted from xkb.

4. The window size is not what is specified in the code.

These issues seem to have no effect on the working of the program.
